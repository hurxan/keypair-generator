## Keypair Generator

A simple project based on PHP that: 

```markdown
1. Generates a keypair with a chosen algorithm.
2. Computes the signature of a message.
3. Verifies the singature created before.

```
The application is based on the OpenSSL library so make sure you have it enabled from the php.ini file.<br />

For more details see [OpenSSL installation](http://php.net/manual/en/openssl.installation.php).
